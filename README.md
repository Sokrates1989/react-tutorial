# 🚀 React Learning

A personal project created to capture and grow my React knowledge. It serves as a structured foundation where I apply what I learn throughout a [React Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/learn/lecture/17039094#overview), modularizing my progress step by step.

# 📖 Overview

This repository reflects my learning journey in React. It's not just a codebase—it's a living template that expands as I go deeper into React fundamentals, patterns, tooling, and ecosystem insights. The goal is to have a robust base I can reuse for future projects or as a reference.

Each module is clearly separated and well-documented.
