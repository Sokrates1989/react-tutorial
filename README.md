# 📖 Overview

This repository reflects my learning journey in React. It's not just a codebase—it's a living template that expands as I go deeper into React fundamentals, patterns, tooling, and ecosystem insights. The goal is to have a robust base I can reuse for future projects or as a reference.

Each module is clearly separated and well-documented.

<br><br>

# 🧑‍💻 Usage

You can clone and run the template using the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/react-learning-template.git
cd react-learning-template
npm install
npm start
```

Modules are added in folders under `src/modules/`, each containing its own README and examples.

# 🛠️ Setup & Structure

This project uses:

- React (Vite or CRA – depending on section)
- ESLint + Prettier for consistent code style
- Folder structure designed for scalability
- Tailwind CSS / CSS Modules (depending on lesson)
