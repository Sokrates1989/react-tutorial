# 🚀 React Learning

A personal project created to capture and grow my React knowledge. It serves as a structured foundation where I apply what I learn throughout a [React Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/learn/lecture/17039094#overview), modularizing my progress step by step.

# 📖 Overview

This repository reflects my learning journey in React. It's not just a codebase—it's a living template that expands as I go deeper into React fundamentals, patterns, tooling, and ecosystem insights. The goal is to have a robust base I can reuse for future projects or as a reference.

Each module is clearly separated and well-documented.

# 🧑‍💻 Usage

You can clone and run the template using the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sokrates1989/react-tutorial.git
```


<br><br>

# 🛠️ Setup & Structure

Modules are directly added to the root as directories such as "Keepa", "props", "..."

The living template resides at "/template"
